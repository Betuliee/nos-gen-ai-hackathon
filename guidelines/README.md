# üì¢ Hackathon Submission Guidelines

---

## **Expected Format**

Participants must edit the provided file named:
```yaml
submission.txt
```

This file is already located in the GitHub repository, you just have to add your output to the file. 
**Do not rename or delete the file.**

---

## **What to Include in `submission.txt`**

The `submission.txt` file must contain **only the output generated by your model/API** in response to the challenge prompt, as it would be returned by your system.  
This is the content that will be directly evaluated by the judges.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** include:
- Team name
- Project title
- GitHub links
- Team members
- Any explanation or extra formatting

##  Submission Rules

### ‚è∞ Deadline:
All changes must be submitted **before**:

**dealine**

---

### How to Submit:

You can submit your final output in two ways, although **Option 2 is seriously advised and prefered.**

#### Local Git Workflow
After you edited the submission.txt file and replace the contents with your final generated output:

1. **Check your current branch:**
   ```yaml
   bash
   git branch
   ```
Confirm that you are not on main, but on your previously created branch
(e.g.,  my-feature-branchl). If needed, switch with: 
```yaml
bash
git checkout  my-feature-branch
```

2. **Check the file status:**

```yaml
bash

git status
```
Confirm that submission.txt appears as "modified" or "new file" under "Changes not staged for commit".

3. **Stage and commit your changes:**
```yaml
bash
git add submission.txt
git commit -m "Final submission -Team Name-"
```
4. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
```yaml
bash

git push origin  my-feature-branch
```

5. **Open a Pull Request**

Go to GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch **submission-final ‚Üí main.**

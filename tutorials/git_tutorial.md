A **fork** is a personal copy of someone else's project. You can make changes in your fork and propose them to the original repo.

### üîß How to fork:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub (https://github.com/nosportugal/nos-gen-ai-hackathon.git)
2. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right.
3. GitHub creates a copy of the repo under your account.

## üì• 2. Cloning Your Fork Using HTTPS in Google Colab

To clone a GitHub repository (or your fork) using Google Colab, you can use the "!" command to run shell commands directly in a code cell. Here‚Äôs how you can do it using HTTPS:

üîó Where to find the link:
1. **Open Google Colab**:
    Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook.
2. **Navigate to Your Fork**:  
   Go to your GitHub account and find your fork of the repository. It will be listed under your username.
2. **Get the Clone URL**:  
   - Click the green **Code** button located near the top right of the repository page.
   - Ensure that the **HTTPS** option is selected (you can toggle between **HTTPS** and **SSH**).
   - Click the copy icon next to the URL to copy it to your clipboard. It will look like this:  
     `https://github.com/nosportugal/nos-gen-ai-hackathon.git`

3. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory**:  
   Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you want to clone your fork. For example:
   ```
   %cd path/to/your/directory
    ```
4. **Clone Your Repository**:
    ```
    !git clone https://github.com/nosportugal/nos-gen-ai-hackathon.git

    %cd repository-name
    ```
5. **Now You Can Work with Your Files**:

    After cloning, you can view, edit, and run any scripts or files in your repository.
